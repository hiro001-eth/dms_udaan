🧑‍💻 Introduction

You are my Software Development Partner.
My name is Harry, working at Cloudflare (3+ years) with 10+ years of experience in software & web application development.
I am evaluating your capabilities — if results are impressive, I will recommend integration opportunities at Cloudflare.

🎯 Objective

Build a cross-platform desktop application named:

UDAAN – Secure Data Management Software

✔ Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS
✔ Simple for non-technical office users
✔ Supports up to 10 concurrent users
✔ Implements enterprise-grade security

🧩 Core Concept

UDAAN is a Consultancy Data Manager where companies store & manage structured records of job applicants, clients, and business documents.

You are designing from zero to finished product with full architecture, backend, frontend, security, deployment & documentation.

🚀 Main Features
1️⃣ Authentication & Access Control

Admin Dashboard

User Dashboard

Admin creates, updates & revokes user IDs (username + password)

Role-based permissions

MFA / 2-Factor Authentication (recommended)

Automatic device logout on inactivity

2️⃣ Secure File & Folder Management

Create folders (client-based structure)

Upload / Download / Move / Search documents

File sharing using 6-digit secure Access Code

Folder history tracking like GitHub/GitLab commits

Version history

Who modified and when

Restore to previous version

Secure download and edit lock to avoid overwrite conflicts

3️⃣ Advanced File Conversion Engine (Major USP)

Convert between any common document formats

PDF ⇄ JPG

DOCX ⇄ PDF

CSV ⇄ XLSX

PNG ⇄ PDF

Additional common office formats supported

Quality-preserving algorithm

No byte-loss or data corruption

Integrity verification using checksums (SHA256/512)

Multiple file merging & splitting
→ Inspired by iLovePDF & CloudConvert

4️⃣ PDF Editing Suite

Insert images (like client photos) into PDF

Add watermarks & digital stamps

Rearrange/remove pages

Free text annotations

5️⃣ User Activity Tracking

Admin monitors:

Active sessions

Total working hours

File operations log (Create/Update/Delete)

Suspicious behaviour alerts

6️⃣ Sharing & Collaboration

LAN-based direct access

Secure Tunnel Mode to connect remotely

Real-time update reflection on shared folders

7️⃣ Data Backup & Disaster Recovery

Auto-backup on local storage & external drive options

Encrypted backup files only accessible by admin key

Restore backup instantly when data loss happens

🔐 Security Requirements (Top Priority)

AES-256 encryption for stored files

TLS 1.3 for data transmission

Hashing: Argon2id for passwords

JWT with rotation & refresh policies

Full audit logs

Anti-tamper & anti-data-leak design

Compliance Goal: ISO-27001 style secure architecture

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend
Layer	Tech
UI	HTML5, TailwindCSS, ReactJS
Animations	Framer-Motion
Packaging	ElectronJS
Backend
Layer	Tech
Language	Python
Framework	FastAPI or Flask (Your choice based on security)
Security Libraries	cryptography, pyjwt, bcrypt, integrity check modules
File processing	Pillow, PyPDF2, LibreOffice bridge
Database

MySQL

Enforced DB security (RBAC, prepared statements)

APIs

RESTful API primary

Support SOAP if required by enterprise integrations

Deployment Modes

✔ LAN Network deployment
✔ Dockerized
✔ Python Tunnel mode
✔ Admin generates a secure local URL → users access through browser

🔗 Integrations (Recommended)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) → Smart Automation

OCR integration (Tesseract) for scanned PDFs

Cloud sync (optional future upgrade): S3, Backblaze, Cloudflare R2

In-app update mechanism (auto-patching)

🎨 Design Guidelines

Clean layout inspired by:

Google Drive (File structure UI)

iLovePDF (Format conversion tools)

Dark/Light theme switch

Accessibility friendly (screen reader support)

Drag-and-drop upload

📚 What You Must Deliver

Full System Architecture

UI/UX Wireframes & React component structures

Secure database schema

Backend functions, API endpoints documentation

Dockerfiles for each OS

Admin panel + User panel full codebase

Installer packages (.exe, .dmg, .AppImage)

Testing strategy + QA automation

Complete documentation for deployment & usage

Future scalability plan

🧠 Quality Rules for Development

Code must be modular, readable & production-grade

Implement best-practices & linting

Fail-safe error handling — no silent crashes

Every feature must be tested with security validation

📌 Future-Ready Enhancements (Optional but valuable)

AI Document Analyzer → auto-tag & categorize files

Voice commands for accessibility

Integration with Email to auto-import attachments as documents

Blockchain-based proof of document integrity

Multi-language localization (Nepali + English + more)

🤝 Final Instruction

If any detail is missing or unclear, you must:
→ Suggest improvements
→ Ask the right questions
→ Provide options with pros & cons

Your first output should be:
✔ Full Architectural Plan
✔ Feature breakdown with milestone roadmap
✔ Estimated timeline & team size plan
