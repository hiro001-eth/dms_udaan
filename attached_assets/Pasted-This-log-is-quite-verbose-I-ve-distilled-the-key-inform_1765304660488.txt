This log is quite verbose. I've distilled the key information your agents should focus on, organized by the most recent and critical action points.

Your agents should look at the following **Important Things**:

---

## 🔑 Critical Login & Status
* **Application:** UDAAN - Secure Data Management System (Web-based DMS).
* **Current Primary URL:** `dmsudaan--infoudaanagenci.replit.app`
* **SuperAdmin Credentials:**
    * **Username:** `admin`
    * **Password:** `admin123`
* **Latest Goal:** Complete all features, especially SuperAdmin functionality, with exclusive file access control and implement advanced features (OCR, collaboration, SSO, etc.).
* **Immediate Confirmation Needed:** Verify that the SuperAdmin can successfully log in and that the **User Management** page is now correctly accessible **only** to the SuperAdmin role.

## 🛠️ Key Agent Focus Areas (Action Items)

The core project needs to shift from planning to execution on the following points:

### 1. File Conversion & Manipulation ⚙️
Your agents need to ensure the following features are fully functional for all users (where permissions allow), replicating the requested iLovePDF features:
* ✅ **Format Change:** E.g., PDF $\leftrightarrow$ JPG/JPEG, DOCX/PPTX/XLSX $\rightarrow$ PDF.
* ✅ **Combine/Merge:** Combine multiple files of *different extensions* into a single selected output extension (e.g., combining a JPG, a DOCX, and a PNG and downloading them as a single PDF).
* ✅ **Download/Print:** Functionality for downloading single files, folders, and converted/combined files.
* ✅ **PDF Edit Features:** Ensure basic features (like rotation, watermarking) are robust, and start building the advanced features (Annotation Suite, Form Creation).

### 2. User & Access Control 🛡️
* **SuperAdmin Exclusivity:** Ensure **only** the SuperAdmin can **create, update, and deactivate users** (and access the `/admin/admin/users` route/page). This logic was recently fixed but needs continuous testing.
* **Folder/Storage Management:** Verify files are being stored properly with correct naming and are associated with the created folder hierarchy and system metadata.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Finish implementing fine-grained RBAC so SuperAdmin has full control, and other users (ORG\_ADMIN, MANAGER, EDITOR, VIEWER) have defined file access based on their assigned role and folder permissions.

### 3. Advanced Features Roadmap 🚀
The project has an ambitious list of 20 advanced sections. The agents need to start implementing the following high-priority features mentioned in the log:

| Section | Feature Priority |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A. Advanced PDF** | Multi-language **OCR** (Tesseract.js) |
| **B. Collaborative** | **Real-time WebSocket** collaboration |
| **D. Integration Hub** | Enterprise **SSO** (SAML/OIDC/SCIM) |
| **E. Advanced Security** | **Immutable blockchain-like audit logs** |

---

## 📌 Development Notes

* **Database:** PostgreSQL is the selected database for metadata, roles, and audit logs.
* **Backend Stack:** Node/Express, Worker Queue (for file processing), S3-compatible Object Storage.
* **Latest Fix:** The bug with the `/admin/admin/users` route and the sidebar visibility for user management has been addressed to restrict it to **SUPER\_ADMIN** only.

Would you like me to focus the agents on **verifying the SuperAdmin login and user creation/management** as the immediate next step, or on a specific **file conversion feature** (like combining files)?
